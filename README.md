# Stock Price Data Engineering Pipeline
This is an end-to-end data engineering project that analyzes historical stock prices of three companies over multiple years. The project demonstrates the full data pipeline lifecycleâ€”from data ingestion to visualization and alertingâ€”using modern data engineering tools and best practices.

ðŸ”§ Key Features
API Integration: Retrieves historical stock data from the Alpha Vantage public API.

Object Storage: Stores raw data in MinIO (S3-compatible object storage).

Data Transformation: Cleans, curates, and transforms data into a structured format.

Database Storage: Loads processed data into a PostgreSQL database.

Visualization: Creates interactive dashboards in Power BI to track market trends.

Alert System: Sends email alerts for significant stock price changes and pipeline failures.

Containerization: Encapsulates the pipeline in a Docker container for portability.

Orchestration: Automates the entire workflow using Apache Airflow.
